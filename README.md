### Machine-Learning-Implementation

An implementation of a complete machine learning solution in Python on a real-world dataset. 


### Problem statement:-

The project is based on operations of a distribution center. The goal of this project is build a model that will predict how long it will take to complete the put-away operaition at the DC based on the inputs.

## Data collection, Cleaning & preparation:-

Data was collected over a month by the receivers present at the DC who are unloading trucks as they come in. After that, data was entered into Excel. Analyzed the data to look for missing values and any other discrepancies. Cross-checked the data from SAP and removed data that were not matching from SAP.  

Using collected data, I 
Various machine learning models were built, as we can see above, and evaluated. Used Mean-sq-error to evaluate.




CV: Cross-validation

Case 1	Linear regression (without constant, without CV)		
Case 2	Linear regression (without constant, with CV)		
Case 3	Linear regression (with constant, without CV)		
Case 4	Linear regression (with constant, with CV)		
Case 5	Polynomial regression (without constant, without CV)		
Case 6	Polynomial regression (without constant, with CV)		
Case 7	Polynomial regression (with constant, without CV)		
Case 8	Polynomial regression (with constant, with CV)		
Case 9	Random forest
