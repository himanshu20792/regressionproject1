### machine-learning-implementation

An implementation of a complete machine learning solution in Python on a real-world dataset. 

This is a regression problem where I try to predict time taken for certain operations to complete.
Various machine learning models were built, as we can see above, and evaluated. Used Mean-sq-error to evaluate.
