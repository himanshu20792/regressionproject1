### machine-learning-implementation

An implementation of a complete machine learning solution in Python on a real-world dataset. 


### Problem statement:-

The project is based on operations of a distribution center. The goal of this project is build a model that will predict how long it will take to complete the put-away operaition at the DC based on the inputs.


Using collected data, I 
Various machine learning models were built, as we can see above, and evaluated. Used Mean-sq-error to evaluate.




CV: Cross-validation

Case 1	Linear regression (without constant, without CV)		
Case 2	Linear regression (without constant, with CV)		
Case 3	Linear regression (with constant, without CV)		
Case 4	Linear regression (with constant, with CV)		
Case 5	Polynomial regression (without constant, without CV)		
Case 6	Polynomial regression (without constant, with CV)		
Case 7	Polynomial regression (with constant, without CV)		
Case 8	Polynomial regression (with constant, with CV)		
Case 9	Random forest
